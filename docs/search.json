For example, I can write\n\\[\nW_\\mathrm{A} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_\\mathrm{A} + ap\\frac{N_\\mathrm{C}}{N_\\mathrm{A}}}\n\\tag{1}\\]\nand reference in-text like so: Equation 1 describes the lifespan of the average antelope in our simple system…Writing math in-line is also possible, you just need to surround it with $ e.g. \\(W_\\mathrm{A}\\) is the absolute fitness of the average Antelope in a population that is predated by Cheetah."
