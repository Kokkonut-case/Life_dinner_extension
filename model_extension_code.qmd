## Tips for making this report

I've created a template for this project, which you can fill in as you make progress. Throughout, lookout for light bulb endowed text boxes (e.g. see @tip-library). These contain suggestions for making a neat, reproducible report that others will thank you for later.

See [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) for a comprehensive guide on markdown syntax.

## Introduction

In this quarto report, you can document your progress on extending McLean, Herberstein and Kokko's (2024) trophic asymmetry informed life-dinner principle theoretical model. 

You could fill out the rest of this introduction with answers to the following:

- what is the life-dinner principle and where did it originate? 

- what question are you testing?

- what is your _a priori_ expectation for how this will change the results?

## Load necessary packages

::: {#tip-library .callout-tip}
## Load your packages early

In the code chunk below, include all the packages you need to generate this report. Putting them all in one place makes it easier for anyone else trying to reproduce your analysis.
:::

```{r}
# packages go here
```

## The model

::: {#tip-math .callout-tip}
## Writing math

Quarto uses the same syntax as latex to formulate equations. See [here](https://qmd4sci.njtierney.com/math.html) for a quick run-down.

Writing math in-line is also possible, you just need to surround it with \$ e.g. $W_\mathrm{A}$

Quantifying fitness in prey species:

$$
W_\mathrm{A} = \frac{1}{\mu_\mathrm{A} + ap\frac{N_\mathrm{C}}{N_\mathrm{A}}}
$$ {#eq-prey-fitness}

@eq-prey-fitness describes the lifespan of the average antelope (pony) in our simple system...
